                        <b>Programming</b> has become an important part of the tech industry. Now more than ever, people
                        are ready to work remotely.
                        One of the best ways to get a remote job in the technology field is to know how to write code.
                        According to the <a
                            href="https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/rankings/best-technology-jobs"
                            target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">U.S News
                            & World Report</a> website, Software Developer is the top tech job in 2021, followed by Data
                        Scientist. Guess what you need
                        to know in these two areas? Programming. According to the <a
                            href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-2021" target="_blank"
                            rel="noreferrer noopener">IEEE Spectrum</a> website, the top 10 programming languages ​​in
                        2021 are; Python, Java, C, C++, JavaScript, C#, R, Go, HTML, and Swift.

                        As you can see, Python has become the most popular programming language this year. It is the
                        most accessible and
                        easy-to-learn programming language available today and its documentation is well written. The
                        Python community is so
                        large that you can access help anytime on the web. So what can you do with Python? You can do
                        data science, machine learning, web application development, computer
                        education, computer vision & image processing, game development, medicine & pharmacology,
                        biology & bioinformatics,
                        neuroscience & psychology, astronomy, and many more. I will redirect you to the <a

                            target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">freecodecamp</a> site which describes in
                        more detail what these areas are.

                    <h3><b>Resources</b></h3>
                    Now let's talk about the resources that I think are useful for learning Python.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>1. <a href="https://docs.python.org" target="_blank"
                                rel="noreferrer noopener">python.org</a></b>

                    <ul>It is the reference for any python programmer. This is the best and most understandable website
                        for learning python. It
                        is regularly updated and has a great section for beginners. Whatever your knowledge, you will
                        come back to this site
                        often.</ul>
                    <b>2. <a href="https://freecodecamp.org" target="_blank"
                            rel="noreferrer noopener">FreecodeCamp.org</a></b>

                    <ul>One of the most famous platforms for learning to code for free. Additionally, I recommend that
                        you subscribe to their
                        <a href="https://youtu.be/rfscVS0vtbw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube
                            channel</a>.
                    </ul>

                    <b>3. <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language/?ref=shm" target="_blank"
                            rel="noreferrer noopener">GeekForGeek.org</a></b>

                    <ul>One of the best websites to find information on python or programming in general. The tutorial
                        library is huge and
                        varied.</ul>

                    <b>4. <a href="https://www.netacad.com/courses/programming/pcap-programming-essentials-python"
                            target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cisco Networking Academy</a></b>

                    <ul>Cisco System offers 75 hours of python lessons free of charge even if you have no prior
                        programming knowledge. This is a
                        great place to start if you are an absolute beginner. You will be able to take two Python
                        programming certifications;
                        PCEP and PCAP.</ul>

                    <b>5. <a href="https://learnpython.org" target="_blank"
                            rel="noreferrer noopener">LearnPython.org</a></b>

                    <ul>This site is also a good start for beginners. A few lessons and exercises will help you put what
                        you have learned into
                        practice.</ul>

                    <b>6. <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/" target="_blank"
                            rel="noreferrer noopener">Udemy 100DaysOfCode Course</a></b>

                    <ul>I know this one is not free but it is worth it. A famous course to learn python for a few
                        dollars (usually $10).
                        Twitter has a large online community that uses #100DaysOfCode (that's where I started my
                        programming journey). I
                        recommend that you take a look at the community even if you don't want to purchase the course.
                    </ul>
                
                    <b>7. <a href="https://www.scaler.com/topics/python/what-is-python/" target="_blank"
                                rel="noreferrer noopener">Scaler.com</a></b>

                    <ul>A curated interactive space for aspiring programmers to learn and master their coding skills in various programming languages.</ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>In conclusion</b>, you can do so much work with python or programming in general especially
                        if you want to work remotely.
                        Once you understand python, it will be easier for you if you decide to switch to a more advanced
                        programming language
                        such as C++. I'll keep this list up to date when I find a great resource that I think could be
                        useful, so bookmark this
                        article.

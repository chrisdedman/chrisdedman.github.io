                    <p>
                        I want to tell a story about a personal accomplishment that I am experiencing this year due to
                        hard work. In 2020 my math level was 0. I did not go beyond my 9th grade of school and had no
                        math training due to the dropping out of school early.
                        I studied for my GED in mid-2020 and suddenly passed.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Later, in early 2021, I enrolled in a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and had to do a
                        math placement because I never attempted high school.
                        The result of this test was that I had to take an algebra class before I could take the
                        pre-calculus, which is the requirement of my CS program.
                        I studied math really hard all summer and ended up being in a pre-calculus class, which was
                        something crazy for me because this summer of 2021 was the first time attending a math class in
                        my life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, I passed my final pre-calculus exam and achieved an overall pass rate of 96% in this
                        class.
                        I made one of my weaknesses, one of my strengths by working hard at it. I'm neither perfect nor
                        a mathematician, but I get better by working hard.
                        Because, like many fields, mathematics is all about practicing to be better. The more you
                        practice, the better you become.
                        In parallel, I passed 4 other courses this semester; Art History 101, Human Development 101,
                        Computer Science Python Course, and CIS CCNA-2 Course.
                        In each class, I achieved no less than 92% overall grade which ends the fall semester with a
                        cumulative GPA of 4.0.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the spring semester, I will be in calculus class. It's a little scary, but as always, I will
                        do my best to be the best version of myself and be successful in this class.
                        I want to leave you here with a recommendation for a book I am reading. The name of the book is
                        "<b><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693655-a-mind-for-numbers" target="_blank"
                                rel="noreferrer noopener">A Mind for Numbers, How to excel at math and science</a></b>".
                        Don't be biased by the name, it's not just a math and science book. You may be familiar with the
                        course on Coursera “<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn"
                            target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Learning how to Learn</a>”.
                        This book is from the author of the course and can be read on its own or in addition to this
                        course.
                        It will guide you through techniques for learning and achieving success in math and science or
                        whatever subject you are studying. Here is a page of the book about <a
                            href="../img/A_Mind_For_Num.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">procrastination
                            and discomfort.</a> Enjoy.
